				<h2> Uniting the Nation with his Swingline Stapler</h2>
				<p> One of the most prolific character actors working today, Stephen Root has worked alongside many of the biggest names in Hollywood. Born in Sarasota, Root majored in acting and broadcasting at the University of Florida and remains a die-hard Gator fan. After three years of touring the U.S. and Canada with the National Shakespeare Company, Root settled in New York, honing his craft in many regional theaters and starring off-Broadway in 'Journey's End' and 'The Au Pair Man'. His Broadway debut came in 'So Long On Lonely Street', which was followed by the Tony award-winning production of 'All My Sons', with Richard Kiley. A starring role as 'Boolie', in the Broadway national touring company of 'Driving Miss Daisy' with Julie Harris, brought Root to Los Angeles where he now resides. Back on the boards, he recently starred with Helen Hunt and Lyle Lovett in ;Much Ado About Nothing', an LA Shakespeare Production. </p>
